# Description
This machine learning project aims to create a Real Estate Price Prediction Model using Regression Testing. The objective is to develop a model that can accurately predict the selling price of residential properties based on a set of relevant features. The model's predictions will be valuable for real estate agents, property buyers, and sellers, enabling them to make informed decisions related to property transactions.  The key features used to predict property prices include the property's total area, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, its location, age, amenities, proximity to essential services, property condition, neighborhood trends, and market demand. Each feature plays a crucial role in determining the property's value.  To ensure the model's continued accuracy and reliability over time, regression testing will be implemented. This process involves periodically testing the model's performance with newly collected data samples of residential properties and their actual selling prices. By evaluating the model's performance metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared value, we can assess if the model's predictive capabilities have remained consistent.  If the model's performance has declined significantly, it will be retrained using a combination of the original dataset and the new data samples. This iterative approach will help maintain a highly effective real estate price prediction tool that can adapt to changing market trends and evolving property data. The final deployed model will serve as a reliable resource for users seeking accurate property price estimations, enhancing their decision-making process during real estate transactions.

# Features
Features:

Area: The total area of the residential property in square feet or square meters.
Number of Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the property, which indicates its size and accommodation capacity.
Number of Bathrooms: The count of bathrooms, including both full and half baths.
Location: The geographical location of the property, which can significantly impact its price.
Age of the Property: The age of the property in years since construction, as newer properties might be valued higher.
Amenities: A binary feature indicating the presence or absence of amenities like a swimming pool, garden, gym, parking facilities, etc.
Proximity to Essential Services: A metric representing the distance to nearby essential services like schools, hospitals, public transportation, and shopping centers.
Property Condition: A categorical variable reflecting the overall condition of the property, such as "Excellent," "Good," "Fair," or "Needs Renovation."
Neighborhood Trends: Historical price trends of properties in the neighborhood, indicating whether the area is becoming more or less desirable.
Market Demand: An index representing the current demand for residential properties in the region.
